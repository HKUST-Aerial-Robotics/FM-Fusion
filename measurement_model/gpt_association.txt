ðŸ˜ƒ YOU: let's restart. I have a list of label names: "wall", "tile wall", "floor", "carpet", "cabinet", "closet", "file cabinet", "dresser", "bed", "chair", "armchair", "swivel chair", "couch", "table", "side table", "round table", "kitchen table", "door", "glass door", "window", "bookshelf", "shelf", "picture", "picture frame", "poster", "counter top", "kitchen counter", "computer desk", "office desk", "curtain", "fridge", "shower curtain", "toilet bowl", "sink", "bathroom sink", "bath", "tub", "bin". And I also have a list of semantic class names: "wall", "floor", "cabinet", "bed", "chair", "sofa", "table", "door", "window", "bookshelf", "picture", "counter", "desk", "curtain", "refrigerator", "shower curtain", "toilet", "sink", "bathtub", "otherfurniture". Classify each label name to the semantic name it should belong to. Each label name should be semantic similar with its classified semantic name.

ðŸ¤– AI: Here are the label names classified to their respective semantic names based on semantic similarity:

Wall: wall
Tile wall: wall
Floor: floor
Carpet: floor
Cabinet: cabinet
Closet: cabinet
File cabinet: cabinet
Dresser: bed
Bed: bed
Chair: chair
Armchair: chair
Swivel chair: chair
Couch: sofa
Table: table
Side table: table
Round table: table
Kitchen table: table
Door: door
Glass door: door
Window: window
Bookshelf: bookshelf
Shelf: bookshelf
Picture: picture
Picture frame: picture
Poster: picture
Counter top: counter
Kitchen counter: counter
Computer desk: desk
Office desk: desk
Curtain: curtain
Fridge: refrigerator
Shower curtain: curtain
Toilet bowl: toilet
Sink: sink
Bathroom sink: sink
Bath: bathtub
Tub: bathtub
Bin: otherfurniture
Note: The classification is based on the semantic similarity between the label names and the semantic names. There might be some label names that could be classified into multiple semantic names, but I have chosen the semantic name that has the highest semantic similarity.
